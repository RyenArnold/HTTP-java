# Simple multithreaded HTTP server in Java
This project is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server written in Java using the java.net library. The server can handle basic GET requests and provide responses as a simple HTML page
# Connecting to the server
Open a web browser and type in http://localhost:8080/. You should see a "Hello, World!" welcome message.
# Notes
1.This project is created for educational purposes and provides only basic functionality to demonstrate the principles of HTTP server in Java.

2.For real-world projects requiring complex features and security, it is recommended to use existing frameworks such as Spring Boot to create HTTP servers with extensive functionality and customisation options.

3.When deploying in a production environment, you need to ensure the security and reliability of the server. Keep in mind input validation, exception handling, and other security and performance related aspects.
